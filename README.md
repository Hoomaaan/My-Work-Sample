# Description of the files
"CPP maximal clique enumeration.zip" contains the C++ (object-oriented) codes for counting the number of maximal cliques in a graph. This folder contains two methods: Tomita and our proposed one in a parallel setting.

"Python Neural Network.zip" contains python object-oriented programming to implement multi-layer neural networks. I have implemented this code for my deep learning course this semester. I also have another python (OO) project which is related to my previous internship, but I have to ask for permission before I will be able to share it.
